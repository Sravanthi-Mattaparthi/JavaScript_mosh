Variables:
Variables are used to store the data or value assigned to it.
To declare variables we use "var" but it will be best practice to use let.
As there are few problems with var.

By default variables which are not assigned gives the console as undefined .

Rules forvnaming Varibales:

1.Should be meaningful
2.It should not use any reserved keywords as if, else etc...
3.Cnnot start with number.(1name())
4. They cannot contain space or hyphen.(first name or first-name)
example we can use camel notation
firstName - first letter will be lowercase and second word will be uppercase
5.are case sensitive

Multiple variable declaration either in single line or multiple line

firstName = "Sravanthi ", lastName =" Mattaparthi";

            (or)

let firstName= "Sravanthi";
let lastName = "Mattaparthi";


KeyPoint:

If you don't want to reassign the value constant will be your choice
If you want to assign value again use variabe.
