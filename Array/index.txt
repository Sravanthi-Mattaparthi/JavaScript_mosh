Array:
Array is a collection of elements, we can use for example list of colors, items in the card. 
Unlike other programming languages array in js allows you to store different types.

Array are declared with square brackets []
Array index position always starts with 0

Example:

let seletedColors = ["red", "blue", "black", "white"];
console.log(selectedColors);


output in console:

0: "red"
1: "blue"
2: "black"
3: "white"
length: 4


//Accesing element through index position

console.log(selectedColors[1]);

output in console: blue

//Extending the size of Array

In js array are dynamic in nature 

let transport = ["cars" , "Bikes"];
transport[2]="Cycle";
console.log(transport);

Output in console:
0: "cars"
1: "Bikes"
2: "Cycle"
length: 3

//Placing different type of element in array

let transport = ["cars" , "Bikes"];
transport[2]=100;
console.log(transport);

output in console:['cars', 'Bikes', 100]
