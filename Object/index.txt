Object:
Objects are reference types.
the reference types are
1.Objects
2.Arrays
3.Functions

example 
let name ="Sravanthi";
let age = 30;

as these are relate to same person, to make them combine together , to represent them as single unit, we use Objects

let person ={
  name:sravanthi,
  age:25,
};


to acess the properties we have two ways of notation
1.Dot notation
2.Bracket noatation

1.Dot notation:

let employee ={
  name:"Satya",
  age:30,
};

employee.age=25;
employee.name="Akhil";
console.log(employee.name);
console.log(employee.age);


2.Bracket notation:

We use square brackets instead of dot . 
we call the properties within single or double quotes 
It is quite common to use  single quotes.
If the key value is denoted with quotes in console also mention quotes




let animal={
  name:"dog",
  bread: "golden retriver",
};

animal["bread"]="German Sheperd";
console.log(animal["bread"]);
